question: What is generative AI and how is it different from traditional AI?
answer: >-
  Generative AI is a type of AI that creates original content such as text,
  images, audio, video, or code based on learned patterns from training data.

  generative AI produces new outputs, enabling tools like chatbots, image
  generators, and code assistants.
